# Website for Open Source Hardware

### Development

This project uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) to run automated tasks for development and production builds.
The tasks are as follows:

`gulp --production`: Same as `gulp serve --production` also run `gulp test` and  not boot up production server

`gulp serve`: Compiles preprocessors and boots up development server
`gulp serve --production`: Same as `gulp serve` but will run all production tasks so you can view the site/app in it's final optimized form

## Text

A student organization dedicated to the development and availability of open source hardware.

- Who are we?
  - We are a Michigan Technological University enterprise specializing in the development and availability of open source hardware.
- What do we do?
  - We are a product development firm that offers design and prototyping through the use of open source software and hardware like 3D printers. Being open source means the instructions we use, the 3D models we create, and the software we write are shared to the commons, where they can be modified or redistributed. We charge a reasonably high design rate up front so that we can make a profit, and then everyone after us reaps the benefits of our work for a massive discount if they choose to recreate it. Anyone who so desires can make changes or updates to our parts, and through this process our parts are improved at a much higher rate than would be possible by ourselves. Open source is all about collaboration.



  Current Projects

We currently have many cool projects we are pursuing.

    GM Automation Cage (Automated 3D printer with a robotic arm)
    Recyclebot V5
    Granulator
    Lasersaur
    Low cost insulation
    Solar
    High-temperature printing



    Future

    We believe OSHE has a very bright future. Weâ€™ve decided to start building our foundations strong so that we can tackle a wide range of problems, and offer an even wider range of solutions. Current future projects include:

        Building more 3D printers
        Becoming more involved in Open Source Ecology
        Hosting workshops on Open Source Ideology
        Designing/Building a wide range of solutions for customers
        Building demonstration products for the community
            Progressive Vision Loss Lenses
            Robotic Arms Within 3D Printing Process
            Recylebot v5 Filament Extruder
            Movable 3D printers
            Granulator v2
